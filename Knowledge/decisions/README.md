# Decisions

Decision notes auto-populate here when the hook pipeline identifies architectural or design decisions during a session.

Each note captures context, the decision made, rationale, and links to the source session.

See [`docs/examples/knowledge-note-decision.md`](../../docs/examples/knowledge-note-decision.md) for an example.

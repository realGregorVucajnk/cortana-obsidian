# Patterns

Pattern notes auto-populate here when the hook pipeline identifies reusable patterns during a session.

Each note captures the pattern, when to apply it, and links to source sessions where it was discovered.

See [`docs/examples/knowledge-note-pattern.md`](../../docs/examples/knowledge-note-pattern.md) for an example.

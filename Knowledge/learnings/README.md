# Learnings

Learning notes auto-populate here when the hook pipeline detects lessons learned during a session.

Each note captures what happened, what was learned, and how to apply the insight in the future.

See [`docs/examples/knowledge-note-learning.md`](../../docs/examples/knowledge-note-learning.md) for an example.

# Hi Cortano,
I would like to document on a high level a couple of specific items, and those are:
1. what needs to be done
2. what's in the roadmap ahead
Specifically, we will focus on LINCS' WRT roadmap. There is some information available on LINCS' WRT roadmap that we will find and reference, but the outcome of this is to provide super high-level items: desires, focus, movements, and so forth.

You and I will go back and forth to identify those, identify things in-flight, identify things that we still need to accomplish, etc. We will end up with a high-level presentation, almost like an infographic, before and after.

# Daily Digest: 2026-02-13

## Narrative

Today's session activity in the openclaw-wifi-testing project appears to have involved attempted pipeline enrichment work from the terminal, though the actual exchanges were not captured in the session logs. Three separate session entries record activity: two explicit /exit commands and one attempted standalone terminal pipeline enrichment run. The pattern suggests iterative attempts to execute or test the pipeline enrichment functionality, possibly encountering issues that led to session exits. Given the zero-exchange pattern across all three sessions, the actual work likely occurred outside the Claude Code interface—either through direct terminal execution, manual testing, or debugging that didn't generate captured interactions. This aligns with the project's focus on session intelligence and pipeline automation, where running enrichment logic in isolation (not through the Claude Code interface) is a legitimate testing pattern.

## Sessions

- **/exit** (personal / openclaw-wifi-testing)
  /exit. The session involved 0 exchanges. Started with: "No user messages". Final response addressed: "No assistant response".
- **/exit** (personal / openclaw-wifi-testing)
  /exit. The session involved 0 exchanges. Started with: "No user messages". Final response addressed: "No assistant response".
- **run the pipeline enrichment from standalone terminal** (personal / openclaw-wifi-testing)
  run the pipeline enrichment from standalone terminal. The session involved 0 exchanges. Started with: "No user messages". Final response addressed: "No assistant response".

## Themes

- Pipeline enrichment execution and testing
- Terminal-first debugging approach
- Session isolation and standalone tool validation

## Cross-Session Connections

- Sessions 1 and 2 (both /exit) represent manual session termination, potentially after attempting the standalone pipeline run in session 3
- All three sessions relate to the same enrichment pipeline work in openclaw-wifi-testing, suggesting iterative attempts to validate functionality

## Unresolved Items

- [ ] No captured logs for the standalone pipeline enrichment execution—unclear if it succeeded or what output was generated
- [ ] Reason for session exits unknown—whether intentional, error-driven, or cleanup after testing
